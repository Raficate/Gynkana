ACCESO
	1. Conectar VPN
	2. Usar las credenciales de a continuación para conectar con el comando siguiente de ssh

	user ssh: mystifying_bhabha
	pass ssh: thah8odooD

	Comando ssh para conectar a The Hub:
	
		$ ssh mystifying_bhabha@arco.esi.uclm.es -p 3333

	En Windows no podemos hacerlo con certificados por lo que hay que hacerlo de la manera anterior.

	3.Para pasar la Gynkana a TheHub y poder probarla con los cambios realizados hay que acceder al servidor mediante WinSCP (ya está todo configurado).

RETOS
	Reto 0: Conectar al servidor TCP ubicado en rick:2000 para recibir más información.

	Test Chamber 1: UDP
-------------------

- Create a UDP server on your machine (on the port you want)
- Send a message to the UDP server at 'rick:4000'
  indicating:
  - the port binded to your UDP server.
  - a blank space
  - the identifier in the first line on this text
  Example: "7777 NjFZJxzRTvlsESULcWOb" (without quotes).

WARNING: Keep in mind that other players may choose the same port.
You must choose a free port.

I will send the query "upper-code?" to your server. It should reply
the uppercase version of 'NjFZJxzRTvlsESULcWOb'.

If all is fine, I will send to your server the instructions to continue.
You have 5 seconds to send the message. 


---------------------------
Welcome to the test chamber number 2. You're doing quite well.
Excellent work. As part of a required test protocol, I will not monitor
the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.

Test Chamber 2: Word counter
----------------------------

- You must connect to the TCP server at rick:3002 and read words
  until you get the flag "that's all". Then you must reply with a
  message that includes:
  - the identifer in the first line on this text
  - a blank space
  - the amount of words you read BEFORE the flag.

Example:
  - if receive: "twenty tiny tigers that's all take a taxi ..."
  - then send:  "3c567093-7f14-4211-8ccd-2905 3" (without quotes).

Then you can receive the instructions to continue.
You have 5 seconds to connect.

Test chamber number 3 is extremely simple.

Test Chamber 3: Reverse words
-----------------------------

- Your client must connect to the TCP server at rick:6500 and read
  words and numbers until you get a palindrome.
- Then, send the string "8ea98cab-9f7" and send back all what it
  received reversing words, but not numbers.
- Finally, send string " --".

Example:
  - if receive: "the 20 twenty tiny tigers take 12 taxis anna to town ..."
  - the send:   "8ea98cab-9f7 eht 20 ytnewt ynit sregit ekat 12 sixat --"

Then you can receive the instructions to continue.
You have 5 seconds to connect.

identifier:8335a0d3-af35-44a3-b7a8-80

Please, note that the increase in the difficulty of test chambers is
merely a device to enhance your testing experience. Anyway, I regret
to inform you that this next test is impossible. Quit now.

Test Chamber 4: MD5
-------------------

- Connect to the server rick:9000 and send the identifier
  string: '8335a0d3-af35-44a3-b7a8-80' (without quotes)
- You will receive the contents of a binary file, preceded by its size in bytes (in ASCII
  coding) and a colon character (':').
- Calculate the MD5 sum of that file.
- Send result (binary format) to the server.

If it's right, the server will give you instructions to continue.
You have 20 seconds to complete the challenge.

Hints:
- Example: The MD5 digest for the file located in the-hub:/data
  is 'd5d9f7918683cd271edc3b9e6e17bc50' (hex format)
